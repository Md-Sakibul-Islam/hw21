<h4>Russia has vetoed a resolution at the UN Security Council calling on all countries to prevent an arms race in
    outer
    space.</h4>

<p>The draft resolution, put forward by the US and Japan, sought to reaffirm a principle already set out in the 1967
    Outer Space Treaty.

    The US has warned that Russia is believed to be developing a space-based, anti-satellite nuclear weapon.

    Russia said it was "firmly committed" to the existing treaty.

    The draft, put forward on Wednesday, called on "all States, in particular those with major space capabilities,
    to
    contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in
    outer space."</p>
